## 🎯 Project Overview

The WebSpeech V front-end modernization initiative aims to transform the current basic HTML/JavaScript interface into a state-of-the-art web application that:

- Provides an intuitive, visually appealing user interface
- Incorporates MacMilling branding throughout
- Implements advanced audio visualization features
- Ensures accessibility and responsive design
- Maintains compatibility with the existing Flask backend
- Enables future extensibility and enhancements

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read [CONCEPTS.md](./CONCEPTS.md) for overall vision and technical approach
   - Review [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md) for implementation roadmap

2. **Technology Stack** (Recommended)
   - Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript
   - State Management: Zustand
   - UI Components: Custom with Tailwind CSS
   - Build Tool: Vite
   - Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright

3. **Development Phases**
   - Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture (Weeks 1-2)
   - Phase 2: Core UI Components (Weeks 3-5)
   - Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 6-8)
   - Phase 4: Performance & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
   - Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment (Weeks 11-12)
   - Phase 6: Extended Functionality (Future)
